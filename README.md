# ClickCraft - Python GUI Builder

ClickCraft is a Python application that simplifies GUI creation by enabling users to design interfaces with minimal coding and more click-based interactions. With ClickCraft, users can drag-and-drop various GUI components onto a canvas to build layouts visually. Once the design is complete, ClickCraft generates Python code for the GUI, allowing users to download and customize the code as needed.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop GUI Creation**: Quickly add components like buttons, labels, text boxes, and more to the canvas with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Real-Time Code Generation**: As you build the interface, ClickCraft generates Python code for the GUI in real time.
- **Customizable Components**: Change properties of each component, such as text, color, size, and positioning.
- **Exportable Code**: Download the generated Python code to your system to add functionality or further customize your interface.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI, designed for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Components

ClickCraft currently supports the following components:
- **Basic Elements**: Button, Label, Text Box (Entry), Text Area, Checkbox, Radio Button, Dropdown
- **Containers and Layouts**: Frame, Tabs, Grid Layout, Scroll Bar
- **Advanced Elements**: List Box, Tree View, Table, Slider, Progress Bar, Spin Box
- **Navigation and Menus**: Menu Bar, Toolbar, Status Bar
- **Dialog and Pop-Ups**: Message Box, Confirmation Dialog, Input Dialog, Color Picker
- **Multimedia**: Image, Video, and Audio embedding

## Usage

1. **Launching ClickCraft**
   - After running the `clickcraft.py` file, the ClickCraft interface will open.
   - You’ll see a blank canvas on the left, a component sidebar on the right, and a menu at the top with options like *New Project*, *Save Code*, and *Export Code*.

2. **Adding Components**
   - Drag components from the sidebar (e.g., Button, Label, Text Box) and drop them onto the canvas.
   - Position each component as needed, and customize its properties using the settings panel.

3. **Generating Code**
   - As you design, ClickCraft generates the corresponding Python code for each component.
   - You can view or export the code to a `.py` file once your design is complete.

4. **Exporting the Code**
   - Use the *Export Code* option in the menu to save the generated Python code to your system.
   - The exported code can be run with Python to display your GUI layout, ready for any additional functionality.
